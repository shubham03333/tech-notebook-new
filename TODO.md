# TODO: Implement Default Category for New Notes

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Modify `loadCategories` in `src/context/NotesContext.jsx` to ensure "Default" is always the first category in the list.
- [ ] Update the fallback categories to include "Default" as the first option.
- [ ] Test that new notes without a selected category are saved to "Default".
