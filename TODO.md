# Task: Enhance NoteEditor with Rich Text Editing (Bold/Italic WYSIWYG)

## Steps:
- [ ] 1. Add a popular React rich text editor library to dependencies, e.g., Draft.js
- [ ] 2. Refactor src/components/NoteEditor.jsx to replace textarea with Draft.js Editor component
- [ ] 3. Integrate toolbar buttons with rich text editor commands for bold and italic toggling
- [ ] 4. Adjust state management for rich text content
- [ ] 5. Update save and auto-save logic to store content in appropriate format (persist as markdown or raw text)
- [ ] 6. Test editor UI for correct functionality: typing, bold, italic, undo, redo
- [ ] 7. Ensure existing preview and export features work correctly or adjust accordingly
- [ ] 8. Cleanup and code quality improvements

Please confirm if I can proceed with this implementation plan.
